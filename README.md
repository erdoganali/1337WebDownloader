### Assignment
Create a console program in C# that can recursively traverse and download
https://tretton37.com and save it to disk while keeping the online file structure. Show
download progress in the console.
Focus on building a solid application that showcases your overall coding and C# skills, don’t
get caught up in technical details like html link extraction (a simple regex is totally fine).
On top of the basics, we do appreciate it if your program displays a good use of
asynchronicity, parallelism and threading.
During the technical evaluation we will discuss the way you chose to solve the code
assignment, as well as factors like:
➔ Overall code quality
➔ Readability and maintainability
➔ Understanding of the requirements of the assignment
➔ Problem solving and creativity
➔ Testing
➔ Quality aspects other than production code
➔ Polymorphism and object oriented aspects of the code (if applicable in the language)
